                  My name is Tanner Millican. I'm a freelance web developer from Eastland, Texas. I've had quite a few
                  other jobs,
                  but my
                  most
                  recent one was as a POS field technician. I've always had a great fondness for computers and
                  technology
                  in
                  general.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That fondness for technology is what has lead me to the world of coding and web development. Having
                  been
                  a POS technician, I was able to get some hands on experience actually getting to work with technology
                  (computers and company intranet mostly). But something was missing, I wasn't satisfied. And then I
                  found the Coding Bootcamp at UT in Austin, Texas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There, I've learned how to make quality, user-friendly, mobile-first responsive web sites that meet
                  and exceed client expectations. Web sites that I've built utilize many technologies from HTML, CSS,
                  and JavaScript, to Node.Js, Express.Js, MySQL, and others.
